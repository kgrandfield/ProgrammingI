#This program uses a loop to collect five floating-point numbers input by a user, then calculate the total, average, maximum, minimum, and 20% interest for each number.

numbers = [0,0,0,0,0]

numbers[0] = float(input("Please enter first number:\n"))

for n in range(1, 4):
    numbers[n] = float(input("Please enter next number:\n"))

numbers[4] = float(input("Please enter last number:\n"))

total = 0
for x in numbers:
    total += x

average = total/len(numbers)

maximum = numbers[0]
for y in numbers:
    if y > maximum:
        maximum = y

minimum = numbers[0]
for z in numbers:
    if z < minimum:
        minimum = z 

print("Total: ", total)
print("Average: ", average)
print("Maximum: ", maximum)
print("Minimum: ", minimum)
print("Interest at 20%: ")

for i in numbers:
    interest = i + i * .02
