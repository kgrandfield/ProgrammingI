#This program takes two strings input by a user, converts them to lists, and returns the Cartesian product of the two lists.

# Get user input for lists A and B

A_input = input('A: Enter up to 10 numbers separated by spaces').split()
B_input = input('B: Enter up to 10 numbers separated by space').split()

# Convert to integars

A = [int(x) for x in A_input]
B = [int(x) for x in B_input]

# Calculate and print Cartesian product of A and B

C = []

for b in range(len(B)):
	i = b - 1
	for a in range(len(A)):
		j = a - 1
		X = (A[j], B[i])
		C.append(X)

print('AxB =', C)
